The project involves predicting customer churn within the banking industry using deep learning models. The focus centers on harnessing the capabilities of Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) to increase accuracy. K-fold cross-validation and Grid search cross-validation techniques are employed to achieve higher levels of accuracy.

**Accuracy of the Model: 86.85%**
